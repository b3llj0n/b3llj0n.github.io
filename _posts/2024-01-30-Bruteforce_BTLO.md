You can also open it with `Mousepad` search for ease

`3103`

### Question 2) What is the username of the local account that is being targeted? (Format: Username) (2 points)

Because I switched from a Windows O.S to a Kali O.S, I may not be familiar with it, and... I struggled for a while to look at the `.evtx` file .-.
> But... it's so hard to see, my eyes TT

```
evtx_dump.py BTLO_Bruteforce_Challenge.evtx
