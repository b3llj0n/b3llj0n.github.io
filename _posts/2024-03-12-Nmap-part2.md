## `Scan Types` NULL, FIN and Xmas

NULL, FIN and Xmas TCP port scans are less commonly used than any of the others we've covered already, so we will not go into a huge amount of depth here. All three are interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN "stealth" scan. Beginning with NULL scans:

- As the name suggests, NULL scans (`-sN`) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.

- FIN scans (`-sF`) work in an almost identical fashion; however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.

- As with the other two scans in this class, Xmas scans (`-sX`) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark.

  ![image](https://github.com/zs0b/zs0b.github.io/assets/118095276/1ed22870-c4c6-491f-a348-db3d730cc305)


The expected response for open ports with these scans is also identical, and is very similar to that of a UDP scan. If the port is open then there is no response to the malformed packet. Unfortunately (as with open UDP ports), that is also an expected behaviour if the port is protected by a firewall, so NULL, FIN and Xmas scans will only ever identify ports as being *open|filtered, closed, or filtered*. If a port is identified as filtered with one of these scans then it is usually because the target has responded with an ICMP unreachable packet.

It's also worth noting that while RFC 793 mandates that network hosts respond to malformed packets with a RST TCP packet for closed ports, and don't respond at all for open ports; this is not always the case in practice. In particular Microsoft Windows (and a lot of Cisco network devices) are known to respond with a RST to any malformed TCP packet -- regardless of whether the port is actually open or not. This results in all ports showing up as being closed.

That said, the goal here is, of course, firewall evasion. Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming TCP packets to blocked ports which have the SYN flag set (thus blocking new connection initiation requests). By sending requests which do not contain the SYN flag, we effectively bypass this kind of firewall. Whilst this is good in theory, most modern IDS solutions are savvy to these scan types, so don't rely on them to be 100% effective when dealing with modern systems.

### Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag?

`xmas`

### Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?

`Firewall Evasion`

### Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?

`Microsoft Windows`

## `Scan Types` ICMP Network Scanning

On first connection to a target network in a black box assignment, our first objective is to obtain a "map" of the network structure -- or, in other words, we want to see which IP addresses contain active hosts, and which do not.

One way to do this is by using Nmap to perform a so called "ping sweep". This is exactly as the name suggests: Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network. When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive. For reasons we'll see in a later task, this is not always accurate; however, it can provide something of a baseline and thus is worth covering.

To perform a ping sweep, we use the `-sn` switch in conjunction with IP ranges which can be specified with either a hypen (`-`) or CIDR notation. i.e. we could scan the `192.168.0.x` network using:

- `nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254`

or

- `nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24`


The `-sn` switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets (or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify targets. In addition to the ICMP echo requests, the `-sn` switch will also cause nmap to send a TCP SYN packet to port 443 of the target, as well as a TCP ACK (or TCP SYN if not run as root) packet to port 80 of the target.

### How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation)

`nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16`

## `NSE Scripts` Overview

The **N**map **S**cripting **E**ngine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive the script library is.

There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:

- `safe`:- Won't affect the target

- `intrusive`:- Not safe: likely to affect the target

- `vuln`:- Scan for vulnerabilities

- `exploit`:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability

- `auth`:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)

- `brute`:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services

- `discovery`:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

A more exhaustive list can be found [here](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html).

In the next task we'll look at how to interact with the NSE and make use of the scripts in these categories.

### What language are NSE scripts written in?

`Lua`

### Which category of scripts would be a very bad idea to run in a production environment?

`intrusive`

## `NSE Scripts` Working with the NSE

In Task 3 we looked very briefly at the `--script` switch for activating NSE scripts from the `vuln` category using `--script=vuln`. It should come as no surprise that the other categories work in exactly the same way. If the command `--script=safe` is run, then any applicable safe scripts will be run against the target (Note: only scripts which target an active service will be activated).

To run a specific script, we would use `--script=<script-name>` , e.g. `--script=http-fileupload-exploiter`.

Multiple scripts can be run simultaneously in this fashion by separating them by a comma. For example: `--script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares`.

Some scripts require arguments (for example, credentials, if they're exploiting an authenticated vulnerability). These can be given with the `--script-args` Nmap switch. An example of this would be with the `http-put` script (used to upload files using the PUT method). This takes two arguments: the URL to upload the file to, and the file's location on disk.  For example:

`nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'`

Note that the arguments are separated by commas, and connected to the corresponding script with periods (i.e.  `<script-name>.<argument>`).

A full list of scripts and their corresponding arguments (along with example use cases) can be found [here](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/).

Nmap scripts come with built-in help menus, which can be accessed using nmap `--script-help <script-name>`. This tends not to be as extensive as in the link given above, however, it can still be useful when working locally.

### What optional argument can the `ftp-anon.nse` script take?

`maxlist`

## `NSE Scripts` Searching for Scripts

Ok, so we know how to use the scripts in Nmap, but we don't yet know how to find these scripts.

We have two options for this, which should ideally be used in conjunction with each other. The first is the page on the [Nmap website](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/) (mentioned in the previous task) which contains a list of all official scripts. The second is the local storage on your attacking machine. Nmap stores its scripts on Linux at `/usr/share/nmap/scripts`. All of the NSE scripts are stored in this directory by default -- this is where Nmap looks for scripts when you specify them.

There are two ways to search for installed scripts. One is by using the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db` file. Despite the extension, this isn't actually a database so much as a formatted text file containing filenames and categories for each available script.

![image](https://github.com/zs0b/zs0b.github.io/assets/118095276/f7e90f3f-f7c6-4ba9-9ec2-ea70ebdbf821)

Nmap uses this file to keep track of (and utilise) scripts for the scripting engine; however, we can also grep through it to look for scripts. For example: `grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`.

![image](https://github.com/zs0b/zs0b.github.io/assets/118095276/ea3329a3-34d5-4cc4-86e2-f50aec4ac0b4)

The second way to search for scripts is quite simply to use the ls command. For example, we could get the same results as in the previous screenshot by using `ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*`:

![image](https://github.com/zs0b/zs0b.github.io/assets/118095276/d0b324f8-3c59-4cde-9512-22e3aee5b273)

Note the use of asterisks (`*`) on either side of the search term

The same techniques can also be used to search for categories of script. For example:
`grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`

![image](https://github.com/zs0b/zs0b.github.io/assets/118095276/47ad7f53-c34f-4590-9bf0-1dcb3bb41f51)

*nstalling New Scripts*

We mentioned previously that the Nmap website contains a list of scripts, so, what happens if one of these is missing in the `scripts` directory locally? A standard `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap` should fix this; however, it's also possible to install the scripts manually by downloading the script from Nmap (`sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse`). This must then be followed up with `nmap --script-updatedb`, which updates the `script.db` file to contain the newly downloaded script.

It's worth noting that you would require the same "updatedb" command if you were to make your own NSE script and add it into Nmap -- a more than manageable task with some basic knowledge of Lua!

### Search for "smb" scripts in the `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/` directory using either of the demonstrated methods.

What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server?

`smb-os-discovery.nse`

### Read through this script. What does it depend on?

`smb-brute`

## Firewall Evasion

We have already seen some techniques for bypassing firewalls (think stealth scans, along with NULL, FIN and Xmas scans); however, there is another very common firewall configuration which it's imperative we know how to bypass.

Your typical Windows host will, with its default firewall, block all ICMP packets. This presents a problem: not only do we often use *ping* to manually establish the activity of a target, Nmap does the same thing by default. This means that Nmap will register a host with this firewall configuration as dead and not bother scanning it at all.

So, we need a way to get around this configuration. Fortunately Nmap provides an option for this: `-Pn`, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive, effectively bypassing the ICMP block; however, it comes at the price of potentially taking a very long time to complete the scan (if the host really is dead then Nmap will still be checking and double checking every specified port).

It's worth noting that if you're already directly on the local network, Nmap can also use ARP requests to determine host activity.

There are a variety of other switches which Nmap considers useful for firewall evasion. We will not go through these in detail, however, they can be found [here](https://nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html).

The following switches are of particular note:

- `-f`:- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.

- An alternative to `-f`, but providing more control over the size of the packets: `--mtu <number>`, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This must be a multiple of 8.

- `--scan-delay <time>ms`:- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.

- `--badsum`:- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.

### Which simple (and frequently relied upon) protocol is often blocked, requiring the use of the -Pn switch?

`ICMP`

### [Research] Which Nmap switch allows you to append an arbitrary length of random data to the end of packets?

![image](https://github.com/zs0b/zs0b.github.io/assets/118095276/d5db0a10-87f1-44f0-8645-f4aa1b6013b8)

`--data-length`

## Practical

Use what you've learnt to scan the target machine and answer the following questions!

(Note: If you're not a subscriber, make sure that this machine has had around ten minutes to start)

### Does the target ip respond to ICMP echo (ping) requests (Y/N)?

`N`

### Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?

`999`

### There is a reason given for this -- what is it?

**Note**: The answer will be in your scan results. Think carefully about which switches to use -- and read the hint before asking for help!

`No Response`

### Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open?

`5`

### Open Wireshark (see Cryillic's Wireshark Room for instructions) and perform a TCP Connect scan against port 80 on the target, monitoring the results. Make sure you understand what's going on. Deploy the `ftp-anon` script against the box. Can Nmap login successfully to the FTP server on port 21? (Y/N)

`Y`
